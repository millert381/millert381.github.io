It allows you to create isolated environments for Python projects, ensuring that dependencies do not interfere with each other. It's considered good practice to use virtual environments for your projects. Here's a brief description of Python virtual environments:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Isolation: Virtual environments provide a way to isolate different Python projects from each other. This means that you can have one project with specific library versions and dependencies that won't conflict with another project's requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dependency Management: You can install and manage project-specific dependencies within a virtual environment, making it easier to keep track of which packages are required for a particular project. This helps prevent version conflicts and keeps your system-wide Python installation clean.</p> </li> <li> <p>Version Compatibility: Virtual environments allow you to use different versions of Python for different projects. For example, you can have one project that uses Python 2.7 and another that uses Python 3.8, without conflicts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy Activation/Deactivation: You can easily activate or deactivate a virtual environment, which changes the Python interpreter and environment variables to work within the isolated environment. This is particularly useful when working on multiple projects simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p>Portability: Virtual environments can be created and used on different systems. This makes it easier to share projects with colleagues or deploy them to different environments without worrying about dependencies.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use tools like <code>virtualenv</code> or Python's built-in module called <code>venv</code>. Once created, you can activate the virtual environment to start working within it, and deactivate it when you're done.</p> <p>Here's a basic example of creating and activating a virtual environment using <code>venv</code>:</p> <pre><code># Create a virtual environment\npython -m venv myenv\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)\nmyenv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS and Linux)\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre> <p>Once activated, you can install packages using <code>pip</code>, and they will be installed only within the virtual environment, keeping your project's dependencies isolated. To deactivate the environment and return to the system-wide Python, you can simply run <code>deactivate</code> in the command prompt.</p>"},{"location":"How-To/python/activate-virtual-environment/#practical-example","title":"Practical Example","text":"<p>On my machine, I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 installed.
