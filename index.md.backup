# Everything In One Place

Here is the collective sum of everything I know that I have stopped long enough to write about.

## ECS-MES
Th **ECS-MES** project was designed to be a *simple* OEE & Downtime Tracking application built using Ignition.  In this section, you will find docs related to the following areas:

- Solution Architecture
- Deployment - install and configure
- Software Design

## How-To's
Things that I do on a routine (or as-needed) basis are documented in this section.
