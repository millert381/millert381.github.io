ECS MES is a framework built within the Ignition SCADA platform. This framework provides a simple interface for configuring an equipment model and generating the necessary tags (UDTs) to collect real-time data, including equipment state, count, material, and related production settings. With this data, OEE and Downtime analysis drives purpose-built dashboards and reports

**Key Features:**

1. **Equipment Modeling:** Define your equipment model, including equipment hierarchies, equipment schedules, machine states, materials, etc.

2. **Real-time State Monitoring:** Monitor equipment states in real-time, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime. Receive instant alerts for any deviations from optimal operating conditions.

3. **Count Tracking:** Precisely track production counts and cycle times. Identify bottlenecks and performance gaps to enhance production efficiency.

4. **Material Management:** Manage materials with ease. Record material usage, consumption, and replenishment data, ensuring accurate inventory management and cost control.

5. **Material Production Settings:** Fine-tune your production settings to optimize material usage and product quality. Easily adjust parameters to meet changing production requirements.

**Benefits:**

1. **Downtime Reduction:** ECS MES enables you to identify and address downtime causes promptly, reducing production interruptions and improving OEE.

2. **OEE Analysis:** Gain deep insights into your equipment's availability, performance, and quality. Use data-driven analytics to make informed decisions and drive continuous improvement.

3. **Resource Optimization:** Maximize equipment and labor resources with real-time monitoring and performance analysis. Allocate resources efficiently to meet production targets.

4. **Cost Savings:** By reducing downtime, improving equipment efficiency, and optimizing material usage, you'll realize significant cost savings and increased profitability.

5. **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports and dashboards for OEE analysis, downtime tracking, and material consumption. Easily share insights with stakeholders.

**Use Cases:**

- **Manufacturing:** Enhance production efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve product quality with real-time OEE analysis and downtime tracking.

- **Pharmaceuticals:** Ensure precise material management and adherence to production settings in pharmaceutical manufacturing, where accuracy is paramount.
