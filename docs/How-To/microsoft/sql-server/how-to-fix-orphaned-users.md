# Fix Orphaned Users

## Summary

When you restore a Microsoft SQL Server database on a different machine, you cannot access the database until you fix the permissions.

## Detail

The problem is that the user in the database is an **orphan**. This means that there is no login id or password associated with the user. This is true even if there is a login id that matches the user, since there is a GUID (called a SID in Microsoft-speak) that has to match as well.

This used to be a pain to fix, but currently (SQL Server 2000, SP3) there is a stored procedure that does the heavy lifting.

All of these instructions should be done as a database admin, with the restored database selected.

First, make sure that this is the problem. This will lists the orphaned users:

```sql
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Report'
```

If you already have a login id and password for this user, fix it by doing:

```sql
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Auto_Fix', 'user'
```

If you want to create a new login id and password for this user, fix it by doing:

```sql
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Auto_Fix', 'user', 'login', 'password'
```
