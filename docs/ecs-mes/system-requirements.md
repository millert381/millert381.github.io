# System Requirements

See *System Requirements* at the bottom of Inductive Automation's [Ignition downloads](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/ignition) page.

It is recommended that Ignition and SQL Server run on seperate application servers.  However, it is possible to run both on a single server.  In such case, the amount of memory shown below should be cumulative as a minimum recommendation.

## Ignition Gateway Server

For the ECS-MES application, the recommended specs are:

- 4 core
- 16 GB RAM

## Microsoft SQL Server

For the ECS-MES database(s), the recommended minimum specs are:

- 2 core
- 8 GB RAM
- XX GB disk space (based on desired retention)
